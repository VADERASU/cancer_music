Project that aims to imitate the process of cancer in a patient through a musical analogy.

## Using the script
Install [python-poetry](https://www.python-poetry.org). 
Run `poetry install` inside this directory, and then use the script via either `poetry run mutate_sheet [FILENAME]` or `poetry shell` and then `mutate_sheet [FILENAME]`.

## Developers
Make sure to use poetry to manage your dependencies, it'll make things a lot easier. 
When installing the project for the first time, be sure to run `poetry install -D` to get all the development tools.
Make sure to set up a proper editor (VSCode, NeoVim, etc.) that can take advantage of all of the automatic formatting and linting tools in the dev dependencies.
